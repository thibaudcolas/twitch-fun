# Twitch fun

> A place to keep all of my hard-earned Twitch streaming knowledge

## Tools

* [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/thibaudcolas)
* [OBS](https://obsproject.com/)
* [KeyCastr](https://github.com/keycastr/keycastr)
* TODO: a better window position manager

## Hard-earned knowledge

* Do not use scaled video output â€“ stream with the canvas size.
* Turn on recordings in Twitch as well as in OBS.
